This a fork of the SOWFA (Simulator for Offshore Wind Farm Applications),
created at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). The original
project can be downloaded or cloned here:

The purpose of this fork is to implement a nesting procedure in 
ABLTerrainSolver and to fix some bugs. As I am not interested in the wind
turbine part, I desactivated the compilation of those sources.

Work in Progress!!
