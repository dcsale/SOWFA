		\begin{itemize}
			\item \footnotesize Code and Computers
				\begin{itemize}
					\item \footnotesize prototype simulations for running on more powerful hardware
					\item shared memory, distributed memory, co-processors
					\item want to understand resolution required to resolve wakes and turbine performance accurately
					\item based upon free and opensource software					
				\end{itemize}

			\item \footnotesize Ambient Turbulence
				\begin{itemize}
					\item \footnotesize turbulent structures within ambient flow can cause loading events with significance comparable to when turbines operate in upstream wakes
					\item boundary data on inlet planes generated from either precursor LES or synthetic turbulence methods (e.g. pyTurbSim)
				\end{itemize}

			\item \footnotesize Control Strategies
				\begin{itemize}
					\item \footnotesize dynamical model of rotor drivertrain to allow variable TSR as response to fluctuations in rotor torque
					\item rotor speed and pitch control for "in-water" dynamometer testing
				\end{itemize}
